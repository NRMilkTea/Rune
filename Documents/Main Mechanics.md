# Main Mechanics

This document explains the details in the main mechanics in my game (with code name "Rune").

## Grid Editing (backpack)

Basically the backpack-organizing mechanic in games like *Backpack Hero* or *Weapon God*.

## Snake

Player controls a "snake" (just like the one in the classic *Snake* game), which lays on the grid.

- Turn-based Movement
  - Player can only move finite steps in one round.

- Length of Snake 
  - The length of snake would increase or decrease.
    - This can gives spells a "cost". Since long snake might be a bad thing, it might be a good idea that the snake grows based on the spell it finishes. (Proposed by Saintan Wu).
